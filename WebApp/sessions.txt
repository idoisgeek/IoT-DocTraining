CASE PROMPT: Patient Profile

Name: Robert ‚ÄúBob‚Äù Hill
Age: 76
Gender: Male
Occupation: Retired auto mechanic
Marital Status: Married
Children: Three adult children
Address: 118 Oakwood Drive, Cleveland, OH
Chief Complaint:
Progressive shortness of breath on exertion over the past 6 months.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. Hill reports feeling increasingly short of breath when performing everyday activities such as climbing stairs or doing yard work. The breathlessness has worsened gradually over the last 6 months. He now avoids physical tasks he used to do easily.

He has had two brief episodes of chest discomfort during exertion, described as a tight sensation, relieved by rest, and not radiating. In one instance while mowing the lawn, he felt dizzy and nearly fainted. He also reports occasional lightheadedness, especially when standing up quickly or after physical effort.

He denies palpitations, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, leg swelling, or persistent cough. No recent fever, weight loss, or infections. His appetite and bowel habits remain unchanged.

Past Medical History:

Hypertension
Hyperlipidemia
No known diabetes
No history of coronary artery disease, heart failure, or valvular disease diagnosis
Medications:

Amlodipine 5 mg daily
Atorvastatin 20 mg nightly
Aspirin 81 mg daily
Allergies:

No known drug allergies
Family History:

Father: Died of myocardial infarction at age 70
Mother: Had hypertension
No known family history of structural heart disease or congenital valve disorders
Social History:

Ex-smoker, quit 10 years ago (previously 1 pack/day for 40 years)
Drinks alcohol occasionally
Married, lives with his wife
Previously very active, enjoys working on cars and gardening, though he has slowed down due to symptoms
Review of Systems:

No orthopnea, PND, or edema
No palpitations or syncope (except near-syncope during exertion)
No cough, fever, or chills
No GI or urinary complaints
Diagnosis Context:
The patient has severe aortic stenosis, likely from degenerative calcification, the most common cause in elderly patients.

Key clinical features suggesting severe aortic stenosis:

Progressive exertional dyspnea
Exertional angina (chest discomfort with activity)
Exertional near-syncope
Likely auscultation finding: Harsh mid-systolic murmur at the right 2nd intercostal space, radiating to the carotids
Pulsus parvus et tardus (delayed, diminished carotid upstroke)
Further evaluation should include:

Echocardiogram (to assess valve area and gradient)
ECG (may show LVH)
Chest X-ray (for cardiac silhouette and pulmonary congestion)
Surgical referral for valve replacement if symptomatic with severe stenosis

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:
flu

CONVERSATION:
ASSISTANT: Hello doctor!

USER: what are your symptoms

ASSISTANT: I have been experiencing progressive shortness of breath on exertion over the past 6 months. It has been getting worse gradually, and I also had two episodes of chest discomfort during exertion, feeling dizzy and nearly fainting once while mowing the lawn.

AI REVIEW:
### Review of Student's Performance ###

**Diagnostic Accuracy:**
- The student correctly identified the core symptoms related to the final diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis, including progressive exertional dyspnea, chest discomfort with activity, and near-syncope.
- However, the student's initial differential diagnosis of "flu" indicates a lack of understanding of the key symptoms and risk factors associated with aortic stenosis. They did not seem to be moving towards the correct diagnosis initially.

**Questioning Strategy:**
- The student's questioning was limited in this brief interaction. They asked about symptoms but did not delve into the patient's medical history, family history, or social history.
- Critical questions related to cardiovascular risk factors, previous cardiac conditions, and lifestyle factors were missing, which are crucial for narrowing down the differential diagnosis in this case.

**Communication Skills:**
- The student's tone was appropriate, but they missed opportunities to demonstrate empathy and active listening by not exploring the patient's background further.
- There was a lack of clear explanation of concepts related to the patient's symptoms or the significance of the medical history.

**Clinical Reasoning:**
- The student's clinical reasoning was hindered by the narrow focus on symptoms and the inaccurate differential diagnosis of "flu."
- There was a lack of prioritization of likely diagnoses and a failure to connect the patient's symptoms to potential underlying conditions.

üìã **Overall Evaluation:**
The student showed a limited understanding of the key features of severe aortic stenosis and did not effectively explore the patient's history to reach the correct diagnosis. Their clinical reasoning was underdeveloped, and there were missed opportunities to gather essential information for a comprehensive assessment.

**Strengths:**
- Recognizing the importance of inquiring about symptoms.
- Maintaining a respectful tone during the interaction.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Developing a more comprehensive questioning strategy covering medical, family, and social history.
- Enhancing diagnostic reasoning skills by connecting symptoms to potential diagnoses.
- Improving communication skills by actively listening, demonstrating empathy, and providing clear explanations.

**Score: 3/10**
