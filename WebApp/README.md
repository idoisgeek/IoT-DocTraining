## WebApp Features
1. Start a conversation with an AI patient based on a selected medical case to diagnose the patient's condition.
2. Submit your diagnosis and receive feedback from the AI agent.
3. Create new cases by adding a case description and uploading four audio recordings corresponding to four different body areas.
4. Edit existing cases â€” update content or replace audio recordings.
5. Review previous sessions, including full conversations and AI feedback.
6. Get server app and RPI connection notifications.
7. Sign up and log in with different user accounts.
8. Configure API settings (e.g., GPT model, temperature) and voice settings for the AI patient.

** Creating and editing cases updates the Raspberry Pi directories in real time via SSH, keeping the Statoscope applicaton always synchronized with the WebApp.
